# Power BI Sales Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

The Power BI Sales Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance by connecting to a MySQL database using MySQL Workbench. This dashboard helps you analyze sales data through interactive visuals and reports.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- **Power BI Desktop**: Installed on your machine. [Download it from the official website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
- **MySQL Workbench**: Installed and configured to connect to your MySQL database. [Download it from the official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).
- **MySQL Database**: Access credentials for the MySQL database containing your sales data.
- **Power BI Service (optional)**: For publishing and sharing the dashboard online.
